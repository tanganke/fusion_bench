# This algorithm merges a pretrained model with a finetuned model.
#
# $$\theta_{merged} = \theta_{ft} + \alpha (\theta_{ft} - \theta_{pre})$$
#
# where $\theta_{merged}$ is the merged model, $\theta_{ft}$ is the finetuned model (medium-aligned model),
# $\theta_{pre}$ is the pretrained model (base model), and $\alpha$ is the extrapolation factor.
