# Reading Lists

!!! info
    working in progress

I've been compiling a comprehensive list of papers and resources that have been instrumental in my research journey. 
This collection is designed to serve as a valuable starting point for those interested in delving into the field of deep model fusion.
*If you have any suggestions for papers to add, please feel free to raise an issue or submit a pull request.*
