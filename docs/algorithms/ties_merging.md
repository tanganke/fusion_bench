Ties-Merging[^1] represents a novel and structured approach to consolidating multiple task-specific models into a single, efficient multi-task model. This method employs a sequence of deliberate steps to systematically merge task vectors, ensuring that the final model effectively integrates the strengths of each individual task-specific model and resolves potential conflicts between them.

The Ties-Merging algorithm operates through three primary steps:

1. Trim: This initial step involves refining the task-specific models by trimming unnecessary parameters, focusing the model on essential elements for each task.
2. Elect Sign of Parameters: In this step, the algorithm selects the appropriate signs for the parameters, ensuring that the integrated model parameters are optimally oriented for multi-task learning.
3. Disjoint Merge: Finally, the method performs a disjoint merge to combine the task-specific parameters into a single cohesive task vector, denoted as $\tau$.

Given the final merged task vector $\tau$, the ultimate model is determined similarly to the method used in task arithmetic. The formulation is expressed as:

$$
\theta = \theta_0 + \lambda \tau
$$

where $\lambda$ is a hyperparameter chosen based on the validation set to ensure the best-performing model.

By following these structured steps, Ties-Merging effectively integrates multiple task-specific models into a unified multi-task model, balancing the contributions of each task to enhance overall performance. The process ensures that the final model retains the benefits of the pre-trained model while optimally incorporating the diverse knowledge contained within the individual task-specific models.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

**Task Arithmetic and Ties-Merging.** Here we illustrate the average performance of models merged using Task Arithmetic and Ties-Merging methods, with varying scaling coefficients. 
The subfigures represent different models: CLIP-ViT-B/32, CLIP-ViT-L/14, Flan-T5-base (LoRA fine-tuned), and Flan-T5-large (LoRA fine-tuned).

In the above figure, we show the average performance of Task Arithmetic and Ties-Merging merged models as the scaling coefficient varies. Subfigure (a), (b), (c), and (d) show the results of CLIP-ViT-B/32, CLIP-ViT-L/14, Flan-T5-base (LoRA fine-tuned), and Flan-T5-large (LoRA fine-tuned), respectively. It is evident that the merged multi-task model hits a peak in average performance across various tasks when the scaling coefficient is set around 0.3. This value was empirically selected as the scaling coefficient in our experiments. As we increase the scaling coefficient beyond this point, the average performance of the model begins to decline, eventually even falling below the level of the pre-trained model’s original performance. This suggests that too high of a scaling coefficient can have a negative impact on the knowledge that the pre-trained model initially possessed, emphasizing the importance of calibrating the scaling coefficient parameter $\lambda$ to avoid diminishing the model’s existing strengths.

## Code Integration

Configuration template for the Ties-Merging algorithm:

```yaml title="config/method/ties_merging.yaml"
name: ties_merging
# Scaling factor $\lambda$
scaling_factor: 0.5
threshold: 0.5
# List of keys to remove from the state dict, default is empty
remove_keys: []
# Function to merge the models, default is sum. Options are 'sum', 'mean', and 'max'
merge_func: sum 
```

Use the following command to run the Ties-Merging algorithm:

```bash
fusion_bench method=ties_merging ...
```

## Scope

Use Ties-Merging to merge multiple task-specific models and evaluate the performance of the merged model.

```bash
fusion_bench method=ties_merging \
  modelpool=CLIPVisionModelPool/clip-vit-base-patch32_TA8_model_only \
  taskpool=CLIPVisionModelTaskPool/clip-vit-classification_TA8
```
