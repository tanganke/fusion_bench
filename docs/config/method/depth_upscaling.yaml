# this should be a list of integers or string, indicating the sequence of layers. If the entry is an integer, it will use the n-th layer of the model. If the entry is a string, it will use the layers specified by the string. The string should be a valid python expression that evaluates to a list of integers.
# for example, ["range(0,12)", "range(6,12)"] will use the first 12 layers and the last 6 layers of the model to construct the new model
# [0, 2, 4, "range(6,12)"] will use the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and the 7th to 12th layers of the model to construct the new model
