  fusion_bench is the command line interface for running model fusion benchmarks in the FusionBench project.
  It provides a flexible way to configure and execute various fusion algorithms on different model pools and evaluate them across multiple tasks.

  == Configuration groups ==
  Compose your configuration from these groups (method, modelpool, taskpool are the most important):

  $APP_CONFIG_GROUPS

  == Config ==
  You can override options, for example:
  fusion_bench method=task_arithmetic modelpool=clip-vit-base-patch32_svhn_and_mnist taskpool=clip-vit-base-patch32_svhn_and_mnist

  == Basic usage ==
  fusion_bench [--config-path CONFIG_PATH] [--config-name CONFIG_NAME] OPTION_1=VALUE_1 OPTION_2=VALUE_2 ...

  == Key options ==
  --help, -h            : Print this help message and exit
  --hydra-help          : Hydra's help
  --cfg, -c             : Show config instead of running [job|hydra|all]
  --config-path, -cp    : Overrides the config_path
  --config-name, -cn    : Overrides the config_name
  --shell-completion, -sc : Install or Uninstall shell completion
