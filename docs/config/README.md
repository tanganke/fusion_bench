# FusionBench Configuration

This directory contains configuration files for FusionBench. 
These configurations are essential for setting up and managing various algorithms and their hyperparameters.

## Configuration Structure

FusionBench employs a modular configuration system, which is divided into three primary groups:

1. **Method Configuration**: Defines the fusion algorithm and its associated hyperparameters.
2. **Model Pool Configuration**: Manages the models involved in the fusion process, including datasets, tokenizers, preprocessors, and other related resources.
3. **Task Pool Configuration**: Specifies the tasks and their corresponding datasets used for evaluating the fused models.
