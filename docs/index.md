## Install FusionBench

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.10 or later (some features may not work as expected for earlier versions)

=== "Install from GitHub repository"

    Install the latest version of `fusion-bench` from GitHub repository and install it in editable mode by passing the `-e` flag to pip.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tanganke/fusion_bench.git
    cd fusion_bench

    # checkout to use a specific version. for example, v0.1.6
    # git checkout v0.1.6

    pip install -e . # install the package in editable mode
    ```

=== "Install from PyPi"

    `fusion-bench` can also be installed from PyPI as a library and toolkit for deep model fusion.

    ```bash
    pip install fusion-bench

    # you can also install a specific version
    # pip install fusion-bench==0.1.6
    ```

Installing `fusion-bench` will also install the latest [stable PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) if you don't have it already.

!!! tip "Introduction to Deep Model Fusion (The Learn From Model Paradigm)"

    Deep model fusion is a technique that merges, ensemble, or fuse multiple deep neural networks to obtain a unified model.
    It can be used to improve the performance and robustness of model or to combine the strengths of different models, such as fuse multiple task-specific models to create a multi-task model.
    For a more detailed introduction to deep model fusion, you can refer to [W. Li, 2023, 'Deep Model Fusion: A Survey'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15698). 
    In this benchmark, we evaluate the performance of different fusion methods on a variety of datasets and tasks. ...
