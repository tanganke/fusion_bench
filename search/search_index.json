We define deep model fusion as the process of combining multiple deep neural networks to create a unified model that leverages the knowledge and capabilities of the individual models. We taxonomize these fusion methods based on their underlying principles and mechanisms, providing a structured framework for understanding and comparing different fusion techniques. We categorize deep model fusion methods into three main types: Model Ensemble, Model Merging, and Model Mixing.</p> <p>The initial diagram presented below provides a visual representation of the Model Ensemble technique.  This method involves the training of several independent models, each generating its own set of predictions.  These individual predictions are then aggregated to produce a final, more accurate prediction. The Model Ensemble technique is frequently employed to enhance both the performance and reliability of models.  It achieves this by leveraging the collective intelligence of multiple models, thereby reducing the likelihood of errors that could arise from a single model's predictions. However, it's important to note that this technique does come with its own set of challenges.  The necessity to train and maintain multiple models can lead to increased computational costs.  This is due to the additional resources required for the training process, as well as the storage needed for each model.  Therefore, while the Model Ensemble technique can lead to improved accuracy, it's essential to consider the potential trade-off in terms of computational expense.</p> <p>Moving on, the second diagram represents Model Merging. This technique involves combining multiple models into a single model of the same architecture. By merging these models, we can create a more robust and comprehensive model that leverages the strengths of its constituent models.  This can lead to improved performance and generalization, especially in scenarios where the individual models excel in different areas.</p> <p>Lastly, the third diagram depicts Model Mixing, a technique where the weights of multiple models are combined to form a new model.  The new model typically has a different architecture from the original models, such as a larger size or more complex structure.</p>"},{"location":"supported_algorithms/","title":"Supported algorithms","text":"<p>Here is a table of supported algorithms in the benchmark:</p> Model Merging AlgorithmsModel Mixing AlgorithmsModel Ensemble AlgorithmsOthers Algorithm Name Class Path <code>dummy</code> <code>clip_finetune</code> <code>.classification.clip_finetune.ImageClassificationFineTuningForCLIP</code> <code>TaskVectorCosSimilarity</code> <code>.analysis.task_vector_cos_similarity.TaskVectorCosSimilarity</code> <code>simple_ensemble</code> <code>.ensemble.EnsembleAlgorithm</code> <code>weighted_ensemble</code> <code>.ensemble.WeightedEnsembleAlgorithm</code> <code>max_model_predictor</code> <code>.ensemble.MaxModelPredictorAlgorithm</code> <code>simple_average</code> <code>.simple_average.SimpleAverageAlgorithm</code> <code>weighted_average</code> <code>.weighted_average.weighted_average.WeightedAverageAlgorithm</code> <code>weighted_average_for_llama</code> <code>.weighted_average.llama.WeightedAverageForLLama</code> <code>clip_fisher_merging</code> <code>.fisher_merging.clip_fisher_merging.FisherMergingAlgorithmForCLIP</code> <code>gpt2_fisher_merging</code> <code>.fisher_merging.gpt2_fisher_merging.FisherMergingAlgorithmForGPT2</code> <code>clip_regmean</code> <code>.regmean.clip_regmean.RegMeanAlgorithmForCLIP</code> <code>gpt2_regmean</code> <code>.regmean.gpt2_regmean.RegMeanAlgorithmForGPT2</code> <code>task_arithmetic</code> <code>.task_arithmetic.TaskArithmeticAlgorithm</code> <code>ties_merging</code> <code>.ties_merging.ties_merging.TiesMergingAlgorithm</code> <code>clip_task_wise_adamerging</code> <code>.adamerging.clip_task_wise_adamerging.CLIPTaskWiseAdaMergingAlgorithm</code> <code>clip_layer_wise_adamerging</code> <code>.adamerging.clip_layer_wise_adamerging.CLIPLayerWiseAdaMergingAlgorithm</code> <code>singular_projection_merging</code> <code>fusion_bench.method.smile_upscaling.singular_projection_merging.SingularProjectionMergingAlgorithm</code> <code>pwe_moe_ls_for_clip</code> <code>.pwe_moe.clip_pwe_moe.PWEMoELinearScalarizationForCLIP</code> <code>pwe_moe_epo_for_clip</code> <code>.pwe_moe.clip_pwe_moe.PWEMoExactParetoOptimalForCLIP</code> <code>clip_concrete_task_arithmetic</code> <code>.concrete_subspace.clip_concrete_task_arithmetic.ConcreteTaskArithmeticAlgorithmForCLIP</code> <code>clip_concrete_task_wise_adamerging</code> <code>.concrete_subspace.clip_concrete_adamerging.ConcreteTaskWiseAdaMergingForCLIP</code> <code>clip_concrete_layer_wise_adamerging</code> <code>.concrete_subspace.clip_concrete_adamerging.ConcreteLayerWiseAdaMergingForCLIP</code> <code>mixtral_moe_merging</code> <code>.mixture_of_experts.mixtral_merging.MixtralMoEMergingAlgorithm</code> <code>mixtral_for_causal_lm_merging</code> <code>.mixture_of_experts.mixtral_merging.MixtralForCausalLMMergingAlgorithm</code> <code>clip_weight_ensembling_moe</code> <code>.we_moe.clip_we_moe.CLIPWeightEnsemblingMoEAlgorithm</code> Algorithm Name Class Description Depth Upscaling DepthUpscalingAlgorithm Depth upscaling algorithm that concatenates the layers of model.

Where \\(P_1\\) and \\(P_2\\) are performance metrics for two tasks, colored lines represent different Pareto optimal solutions, and the solid black line represents the Pareto front.     (b) An overview of the model up-scaling process.     We upcycle the MLP modules to MoE modules and merge the remaining parts using task arithmetic.     (c) The MoE module, comprising a routing network and a parameter decoder network.     The routing network accepts a user preference vector and generates routing weights for weight-ensembling. <p>Abstract</p> <p>Solving multi-objective optimization problems for large deep neural networks is a challenging task due to the complexity of the loss landscape and the expensive computational cost of training and evaluating models. Efficient Pareto front approximation of large models enables multi-objective optimization for various tasks such as multi-task learning and trade-off analysis. Existing algorithms for learning Pareto set, including (1) evolutionary, hypernetworks, and hypervolume-maximization methods, are computationally expensive and have restricted scalability to large models; (2) Scalarization algorithms, where a separate model is trained for each objective ray, which is inefficient for learning the entire Pareto set and fails to capture the objective trade-offs effectively. Inspired by the recent success of model merging, we propose a practical and scalable approach to Pareto set learning problem via mixture of experts (MoE) based model fusion. By ensembling the weights of specialized single-task models, the MoE module can effectively capture the trade-offs between multiple objectives and closely approximate the entire Pareto set of large neural networks. Once the routers are learned and a preference vector is set, the MoE module can be unloaded, thus no additional computational cost is introduced during inference. We conduct extensive experiments on vision and language tasks using large-scale models such as CLIP-ViT and GPT-2. The experimental results demonstrate that our method efficiently approximates the entire Pareto front of large models. Using only hundreds of trainable parameters of the MoE routers, our method even has lower memory usage compared to linear scalarization and algorithms that learn a single Pareto optimal solution, and are scalable to both the number of objectives and the size of the model. Our method significantly reduces the computational burden of learning the Pareto set, for example, in the two-task case, it can be achieved in just a few minutes.

For example, if we have three models and the weight of the first neuron in the first layer is 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 in each model respectively, the weight of that neuron in the final model will be (0.1 + 0.2 + 0.3) / 3 = 0.2.</p> <p>Simple averaging is a straightforward and scalable method for model fusion. It does not require any additional training or fine-tuning, making it a good choice when computational resources are limited, where maintaining an ensemble of models is not feasible.</p> <p>This method often assumes that all models are equally good.  If some models are significantly better than others, it might be beneficial to assign more weight to the better models when averaging.  This can be done by using weighted averaging, where each model's contribution to the final model is weighted by its performance on a validation set or some other metric. See Weighed Averaging for more details.

One intriguing method in this domain is Task Arithmetic, which involves the combination of task-specific vectors derived from model parameters. </p> Task Arithmetic. This figure is credited to <sup>2</sup> <p>Task Vector. A task vector is used to encapsulate the adjustments needed by a model to specialize in a specific task.  It is derived from the differences between a pre-trained model's parameters and those fine-tuned for a particular task.  Formally, if \\(\\theta_i\\) represents the model parameters fine-tuned for the i-th task and \\(\\theta_0\\) denotes the parameters of the pre-trained model, the task vector for the i-th task is defined as:</p> \\[\\tau_i = \\theta_i - \\theta_0\\] <p>This representation is crucial for methods like Task Arithmetic, where multiple task vectors are aggregated and scaled to form a comprehensive multi-task model.</p> <p>Task Arithmetic<sup>1</sup> begins by computing a task vector \\(\\tau_i\\) for each individual task, using the set of model parameters \\(\\theta_0 \\cup \\{\\theta_i\\}_i\\) where \\(\\theta_0\\) is the pre-trained model and \\(\\theta_i\\) are the fine-tuned parameters for i-th task. These task vectors are then aggregated to form a multi-task vector. Subsequently, the multi-task vector is combined with the pre-trained model parameters to obtain the final multi-task model. This process involves scaling the combined vector element-wise by a scaling coefficient (denoted as \\(\\lambda\\)), before adding it to the initial pre-trained model parameters.  The resulting formulation for obtaining a multi-task model is expressed as </p> \\[ \\theta = \\theta_0 + \\lambda \\sum_{i} \\tau_i. \\] <p>The choice of the scaling coefficient \\(\\lambda\\) plays a crucial role in the final model performance. Typically, \\(\\lambda\\) is chosen based on validation set performance. </p> <p>Recent work has also explored task arithmetic in the tangent space, which can provide improved editing of pre-trained models<sup>3</sup>. </p>"},{"location":"algorithms/task_arithmetic/#examples","title":"Examples","text":""},{"location":"algorithms/task_arithmetic/#cli-usage","title":"CLI Usage","text":"<p>Configuration template for the Task Arithmetic algorithm:</p> config/method/task_arithmetic.yaml<pre><code># =============================================================================\n# FusionBench Method Configuration: Task Arithmetic\n# =============================================================================\n# Performs task vector arithmetic: base + lambda * \\sum_i (task_i - base).\n#\n# Notes\n# - scaling_factor controls the contribution of the task delta.\n# - Model compatibility is required (matching parameter shapes).\n# =============================================================================\n_target_: fusion_bench.method.TaskArithmeticAlgorithm\nscaling_factor: 0.3\n</code></pre> <p>Use the following command to run the Task Arithmetic algorithm:</p> <pre><code>fusion_bench method=task_arithmetic ...\n</code></pre> <p>For example, to run the Task Arithmetic algorithm on two models with scaling factor 0.5:</p> <pre><code>fusion_bench method=task_arithmetic \\\n    method.scaling_factor=0.5 \\\n  modelpool=CLIPVisionModelPool/clip-vit-base-patch32_svhn_and_mnist \\\n  taskpool=CLIPVisionModelTaskPool/clip-vit-base-patch32_svhn_and_mnist\n</code></pre> <p>where the configuration for the model pool is:</p> config/modelpool/CLIPVisionModelPool/clip-vit-base-patch32_svhn_and_mnist.yaml<pre><code>_target_: fusion_bench.modelpool.CLIPVisionModelPool\n_recursive_: False\nprocessor: openai/clip-vit-base-patch32\nmodels:\n  _pretrained_: openai/clip-vit-base-patch32\n  svhn: tanganke/clip-vit-base-patch32_svhn\n  mnist: tanganke/clip-vit-base-patch32_mnist\nplatform: hf\n</code></pre> <p>and the configuration for the task pool:</p> config/taskpool/CLIPVisionModelTaskPool/clip-vit-base-patch32_svhn_and_mnist.yaml<pre><code>defaults:\n  - /dataset/image_classification/test@test_datasets:\n      - svhn\n      - mnist\n_target_: fusion_bench.taskpool.CLIPVisionModelTaskPool\n_recursive_: false\ntest_datasets: ???

Similar to Task Arithmetic, TIES merging begins by computing task vectors for each fine-tuned model:</p> \\[\\tau_t = \\theta_t - \\theta_0\\] <p>where \\(\\theta_t\\) represents the parameters of the model fine-tuned for task \\(t\\), and \\(\\theta_0\\) denotes the parameters of the pre-trained model.</p> <p>The TIES-Merging algorithm operates through three primary steps:</p> <ol> <li>Trim: This initial step involves refining the task-specific models by trimming unnecessary parameters, focusing the model on essential elements for each task.</li> <li>Elect Sign of Parameters: In this step, the algorithm selects the appropriate signs for the parameters, ensuring that the integrated model parameters are optimally oriented for multi-task learning.</li> <li>Disjoint Merge: Finally, the method performs a disjoint merge to combine the task-specific parameters into a single cohesive task vector, denoted as \\(\\tau\\).</li> </ol> <p>Given the final merged task vector \\(\\tau_m\\), the ultimate model is determined as:</p> \\[\\theta = \\theta_0 + \\lambda \\tau_m\\] <p>where \\(\\lambda\\) is a hyperparameter (scaling factor) chosen based on validation set performance to ensure optimal model performance.</p> <p>By following these structured steps, Ties-Merging effectively integrates multiple task-specific models into a unified multi-task model, balancing the contributions of each task to enhance overall performance. The process ensures that the final model retains the benefits of the pre-trained model while optimally incorporating the diverse knowledge contained within the individual task-specific models.</p>"},{"location":"algorithms/ties_merging/#hyperparameter-tuning","title":"Hyperparameter Tuning","text":"Task Arithmetic and Ties-Merging. Here we illustrate the average performance of models merged using Task Arithmetic and Ties-Merging methods, with varying scaling coefficients.

It is evident that the merged multi-task model hits a peak in average performance across various tasks when the scaling coefficient is set around 0.3. This value was empirically selected as the scaling coefficient in our experiments. As we increase the scaling coefficient beyond this point, the average performance of the model begins to decline, eventually even falling below the level of the pre-trained model\u2019s original performance.
