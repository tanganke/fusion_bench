"""
Base Program Classes for FusionBench.

This module defines the foundational abstract base classes for FusionBench programs.
These programs serve as the main execution units that orchestrate model fusion
workflows, from loading configurations to executing fusion algorithms and
evaluating results.

The base classes provide a consistent interface for all FusionBench programs
while allowing for flexible implementations of different fusion workflows.

class BaseHydraProgram(BaseYAMLSerializableModel):
    """
    Abstract base class for all FusionBench programs that use Hydra configuration.

    This class serves as the foundation for all FusionBench execution programs,
    providing a standardized interface for configuration-driven model fusion
    workflows. It combines the serialization capabilities of BaseYAMLSerializableModel
    with the requirement for a main execution method.

    The class is designed to work seamlessly with Hydra's configuration management
    system, allowing programs to be instantiated and configured through YAML files.
    This enables flexible, reproducible experiments with different fusion algorithms,
    model pools, and evaluation tasks.

    Key Features:

    - Configuration-driven execution through Hydra integration
    - YAML serialization support for experiment reproducibility
    - Abstract interface ensuring consistent program structure
    - Integration with FusionBench's modular architecture

    Typical Usage:
        Subclasses should implement the `run()` method to define their specific
        fusion workflow. The program can then be executed through the FusionBench
        CLI or instantiated directly from configuration files.

    Example:
        ```python
        class MyFusionProgram(BaseHydraProgram):
            def __init__(self, method_config, modelpool_config, taskpool_config):
                self.method_config = method_config
                self.modelpool_config = modelpool_config
                self.taskpool_config = taskpool_config

            def run(self):
                # Load components
                algorithm = load_algorithm(self.method_config)
                modelpool = load_modelpool(self.modelpool_config)
                taskpool = load_taskpool(self.taskpool_config)

                # Execute fusion
                merged_model = algorithm.run(modelpool)

                # Evaluate results
                report = taskpool.evaluate(merged_model)
                return report
        ```

    Note:
        This is an abstract base class and cannot be instantiated directly.
        Subclasses must implement the `run()` method to provide concrete
        functionality.
